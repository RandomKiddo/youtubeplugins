The `youtubeplugins` repository is a free-use repository under the GNU GPLv3 License (See [License](#license) section for more details, or [License Details](#license-details) for an abbreviated version). You may do whatever you wish with the jar or source code, but please give credit if possible! :D <br>
All of the plugins here can be downloaded for free for use with your own hosted server. Please check this README or the `PluginDescriptions.md` file for more information on what files correspond to what, and their respective versions. <br> <br>

Please note that all of these plugins run on the CraftBukkit (or simply Bukkit) server jar unless otherwise stated (Paper and others will be stated separately)

**If you are having bugs, see the `Issues` tab. If you are having other problems that aren't bugs, or want to edit the plugins, see the `Wiki` tab**

### How to Use

Navigate to the `Plugins` folder, and in that folder, find the file named `PluginDescriptions.md` (Quick Link : [Descriptions](https://github.com/RandomKiddo/youtubeplugins/blob/main/Plugins/PluginDescriptions.md)). Either by skimming, or using the table of contents,
scroll to the plugin you need. In that sections, you should see the plugin name, a short description, version and server info, the name of the jar file, the name of the folder, and a quick link to the folder where the files are stored, and other pertinent information. Either by manually going to the folder named after the plugin, or by using the provided quick link, you will see a list of files in the folder. If you just want the plugin, click on the file ending in `.jar` and download it. From there you can put it in your server plugins folder and run it. If you want to edit the plugin, you can download any other `.java`, `.xml`, and `.yml` files. This repository and its creators are not responsible for anything that occurs when editing the plugin's source code. You can also download `.jar` files in the [Release](https://github.com/RandomKiddo/youtubeplugins/releases) section.

### Running

Download the server files necessary depending on the plugin:
--> Spigot / Bukkit - [Download Here](https://getbukkit.org)
--> Paper - [Download Here](https://papermc.io)
--> Vanilla - [Download Here](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/download/server/)

Download the specific plugin `jar` file from *this* repository. Place the downloaded `jar` file in the `plugins` folder of the server folder

Run the server `jar` file using the command line (**NOT THE PLUGIN `jar`**).
A mac example would be running the following:
```sh
java -jar craftbukkit-1.16.5.jar
```
