# YouTube Plugins - README.md

The `youtubeplugins` repository is a free-use repository under the MIT License (See [License](#license) section for more details). You may do whatever you wish with the jar or source code, but please give credit if possible! :) <br>
All of the plugins here can be downloaded for free for use with your own hosted server. Please check this README or the `PluginDescriptions.txt` file for more information on what files correspond to what, and their respective versions. <br> <br>

Please note that all of these plugins run on the CraftBukkit (or simply Bukkit) server jar unless otherwise stated (Paper or Spigot will be stated separately)

All of these plugins were created in Java by the Eclipse Workspace solely for Minecraft purposes.
