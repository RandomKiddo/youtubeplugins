# Security Policy

Since plugins use the internet, security is a top priorty. Writing thread-safe, protected, and working code is very important, and we want to uphold those standards as much as possible

### Staying Safe

- Do not use any other version or server API than what is explicitly stated in the `README`.
- If you are fearful, refrain from using any content that is in pre-release status or recently merged from an external user
- Look for any open security issues on a plugin before downloading. If there are any open, refrain from using it.
- Refrain from editing source code unless you know what you are doing
- Use common sense and instinct, if necessary

### Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find any sort of security, immediately open an issue in the `Issues` tab and add the ![Security](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/RandomKiddo/youtubeplugins/security?style=flat-square) label
If the vulnerability is super important and dangerous, add the ![Help Wanted](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/RandomKiddo/youtubeplugins/help%20wanted?style=flat-square) and ![Severe](https://img.shields.io/github/labels/RandomKiddo/youtubeplugins/severe?style=flat-square) labels

*If a security problem was already picked up by the `Codacy Security Scan` in the `Security` tab, it is known, and there is no need to report it; it is being worked on*
