### Apache Maven

Maven is an Apache project that aimed to standardize the way programmers build projects, and define, clearly, what a project consists of, and create an easy way to publish and share the project information. Today, it is one of the most popular, if not the most popular, way developers add dependencies to their projects, alongside other project standardizations like [Gradle](https://gradle.org) and [Ivy](https://www.ivy.co)
