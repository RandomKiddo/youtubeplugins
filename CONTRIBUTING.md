### Contributing Guidelines

Contributing to this project is allowed, but not directly. All contributions must be done through forking the repository and then opening a pull request.

### Updating Changelog

The changelog does not need to be updated for contributing. 
The changelog is only meant for release versions. 
Since contributing does not count as use, you do not need to state the changes in a file. The changes made should be stated upon merging the updated files back into the
repository, however.

### Opening a Pull Request

All contributions will be done through forking and pull requests. Please follow the [pull request template](#https://github.com/RandomKiddo/youtubeplugins/master/.github/pull_request_template.md) when opening a pull request. Follow the guidelines, and if passed, the code will be merged to the `master` branch. Please make sure all testing was done before opening a pull request. Untested material will `NOT` be merged!
